## 🧠 How It Works

MomFlow is powered by an agentic design pattern using modular AI "agents" and tools:
- **Meal Planner Agent** – Asks about cuisine, cooking time, and cleanup constraints.
- **Grocery Agent** – Builds a grocery list from the selected meals and can simulate curbside pickup.
- **Event Planner Agent** – Figures out where the kids need to be, when, and who's driving.
- **Wellness Agent** – Checks in with the mom, recommends self-care, and sends affirmations.
